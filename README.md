## P5 from Liam Fernandez, Rebecca Robbins, and Tim Xu


### How to run our code?
Our code does not have any external dependiencies so it can be run the same way as the previous Programming Homeworks.

Open our files with VS code and host the server locally using 'Live Server'.
There is one case where it may show up a file structure instead of the viz directly, if it does this, then click the P5 folder and then our visualization should load.


`console.log("We love our TA's and Dr Clio.")`
